# Coven

An open-world survival RPG in the browser. You play a witch of a broken coven on a 5 km × 5 km island. Gather, hunt and brew to survive, build a village, level your skills, and recruit three sister witches. Coven spells need two, three or four witches, and only the four-witch Grand Rite can break the ward of the Unwitch at the Crown.

Built with JavaScript and Three.js (WebGL 2). The world is deliberately low-detail for now (flat-shaded blocks, no shadows, a short view distance) while the mechanics are worked out; the witch heroes are the exception, modelled in detail with every worn piece of gear shown on them.

## Play

**[Play Coven](https://darkstalkermap-prog.github.io/Coven/)** (once GitHub Pages is enabled for this repository), or download `Browser/Play-Coven.html` and open it offline. It is a single self-contained file.

Use a desktop browser with a keyboard and mouse. Progress saves in the browser's local storage.

**Graphics** (title screen): *Auto* lowers the render resolution when frames slow down and raises it again when there is headroom; *High* keeps full resolution; *Low* also shortens the view distance, for older computers.

## Playing alone

In single player (not online), any spell can be cast as long as its materials are met: its mana and reagents. Coven rites need no Spellcraft level and no sisters beside you; online, the coven rules apply.

## Multiplayer

Tick **Play online with others** on the title screen, pick a name and optionally a **coven name**, then choose how to connect:

- **Host a game**: your browser runs the world. Once you enter the isle you get a four-letter **game code** (also shown top-left) to give your friends. Keep the tab open: if you close it, the game ends for everyone. Up to eight players.
- **Join with a code**: enter the host's code.
- **Server**: connect to a Coven server (see below) and pick a **world** name; for larger or always-on games.

Hosted games need no server of your own: browsers connect directly (WebRTC, via [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/)), and PeerJS's free public service only introduces them by code. A few strict networks block direct connections; use a server there.

Everyone in the same game shares the isle:

- You see each other's witches (class colours, name and coven overhead) and can chat with **Enter**.
- Players who enter the **same coven name** form a real coven: each one within 25 m counts toward coven rites, alongside any AI sisters. Four real players can cast the Grand Rite together.
- Trees, rocks and herbs someone depletes disappear for everyone until they regrow.
- Everyone's village buildings are visible (and solid) to all.
- The Unwitch is shared: her health, a broken ward and the final blow count for everyone at the Crown.
- Wildlife is shared: everyone sees the same creatures, they hunt whichever player is nearest, and the player who lands the killing blow gets the loot and experience. Each creature is run by the player who spawned it; if that player leaves or walks away, the nearest other player takes it over.

On a server, worlds are named rooms (default `isle`), up to 32 players each. A game's shared state lasts while someone is in it (or, when hosted, while the host stays); your own progress always saves in your browser.

### Running a server

The server (`server/`) serves the game and hosts the worlds over WebSockets at `/ws`.

- **Render (free):** in Render choose *New → Blueprint* and pick this repository; `render.yaml` does the rest. Players can then play at the Render address directly, online by default.
- **GitHub Pages:** to make the Pages build connect to that server, add a repository variable `COVEN_SERVER` (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables) set to the server address, e.g. `https://coven.onrender.com`, and re-run the Pages workflow. Players can also paste a server address into the menu.
- **Locally / LAN:** `npm start` builds and serves on port 8080 with multiplayer; friends on your network can join at `http://<your-ip>:8080`.

Render's free tier sleeps when idle, so the first connection after a quiet spell can take up to a minute.

## The world

The island is split into four lands around the Crown, a mountain summit at its centre. Mountain ridges with passes divide the lands. Danger rises from 1 at the coast to 12 at the Crown.

Each land is mapped into three **zones** by level, ringed towards the Crown; the HUD shows the zone you are in and its levels, and the map [M] outlines them:

| Levels | Mirefen | Gloamwood | Springvale | Greenwood |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1–3 (green) | Mirefen Shallows | Gloam Edge | Springvale Fields | Greenwood Glades |
| 4–7 (yellow) | Rotwater Reach | Hollow Night Wood | Hive Hills | Howling Pines |
| 8–11 (orange) | Wyrmdeep Bog | Mourning Thicket | Bramble Heath | Elderhorn Old Growth |
| 12–15 (red) | The Crown | | | |

Ponds and small lakes lie all over the lowlands (one a short walk from every Hearth), so there is always water to drink nearby.

**The sky** turns from blue day through a glowing sunset to a starry night: a rayed sun with a warm halo, a cratered moon ringed by slowly turning runes, aurora ribbons over the north, shooting stars, and fireflies round you after dark.

| Land | Quadrant | Witch | Herbs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The Mirefen (swamp) | south-west | Bog Witch | Mirecap, Bog Myrtle, Leechweed |
| The Gloamwood (dark forest) | north-west | Hex Witch | Nightshade, Gravemoss, Shadowcap |
| Springvale Meadows | south-east | Bloom Witch | Sunpetal, Honeyclover, Dewbell |
| The Greenwood (forest) | north-east | Wild Witch | Wolfsbane, Elderberry, Fernheart |

Each land has a **Hearth** (class starting point, with that path's elder) and a **Lair** guarded by an elite. Stone circles (attune to make them your respawn point), ruins (one-time caches) and shrines (daily full restore) are scattered across the isle. Moonstone is mined in the Crown mountains with a Stone Pick.

## Human villages

Eight walled villages (two in each land) hold houses, a chapel, a market stall, villagers, gate guards and **witch hunters**. Humans hate witches:

- Walk in as yourself and the **alarm** goes up: witch hunters chase you down and villagers flee. An alarm lasts three minutes.
- Cast **Glamour** [8] (needs Glamour Dust, brewed from Dewbell, Nightshade and a feather; your elder sends you two pinches when you brew your first potion) to wear a human face for 150 seconds. Your coven sisters and familiar wait outside. Enter through a gate and trade with the merchant [E]: sell hides, herbs, potions and essences for **silver**; buy bread, ale, bandages, a Wool Cloak, and Iron Hatchets and Picks that gather far more.
- Casting any other spell, striking anyone, or letting the glamour run out inside the walls breaks the illusion and raises the alarm. You cannot glamour a village that is already on guard.
- A human who dies near you leaves a **soul**. Carry empty **Soul Jars** (made at your Ritual Altar from moonstone and slime) to capture them.
- **Human Souls** are the price of the ultimate summon: **Summon the Wyrd Titan** [9] needs four witches, three souls and a Heartfire Sigil, and raises a colossal ally for 90 seconds. Summon her at the Crown, where she can face the Unwitch.

## Witch classes and familiars

| Class | Spells | Familiar | Bonus | Ability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bog Witch | Leech Bolt, Miasma | Grimtoad | Immune to poison | Strikes and spells poison foes |
| Hex Witch | Shadow Bolt, Withering Hex | Corvin the Raven | Undiscovered places show on the compass | +25% spell damage at night |
| Bloom Witch | Sunburst, Renewal | Clover the Hare | +15% move speed | Herbs and berries yield double |
| Wild Witch | Thorn Lash, Barkskin | Ember the Fox | +1 meat and hide from hunts | Ember fights beside you |

## Creatures

Ten per land (40 in all), from timid prey to hunters that only come out at night. The tenth of each land is an elite that drops **Heartfire**:

- **Mirefen:** Bog Toad, Marsh Heron, Mire Leech, Mudback Boar, Fen Crawler, Will-o'-Wisp, Bog Serpent, Rotting Shambler, Moss Troll, *Grendlemaw the Fen Wyrm*
- **Gloamwood:** Gloom Bat, Shadow Hare, Gravecrow, Duskwolf, Webweaver, Hollow Stag, Gloam Stalker, Bone Revenant, Night Hag's Shade, *Old Mournhide the Shadow Bear*
- **Springvale:** Meadow Rabbit, Bumble Drone, Spring Deer, Gilded Pheasant, Thornback Hedgehog, Hollow Scarecrow, Highmeadow Ram, Pixie Swarm, Bramble Bull, *Queen Vesperia the Great Hornet*
- **Greenwood:** Red Squirrel, Greenwood Deer, Wild Boar, Tusked Badger, Grey Wolf, Horned Owl, Treant Sapling, Brown Bear, Moonhowler, *Elderhorn the Ancient Stag*

Creatures drop meat, hide, bone, feathers, slime, chitin, silk, venom, ectoplasm, honeycomb and the essences of their land.

## Getting started

Every Hearth sits in a generous patch of its land's trees, bushes, rocks and herbs (about 350 m around), with **bird's nests** that give feathers. Two trees, two bushes and one nest are enough for your first **Witch's Broom** (8 wood, 6 fiber, 4 feathers).

## Loot and rarity

Creatures drop armor and weapons scaled to their level, in five rarities: **grey** (Poor), **green** (Uncommon), **blue** (Rare), **purple** (Epic) and **gold** (Legendary). Higher rarity means bigger stats and more bonus stats (health, mana, spell power, armor, speed). Better rarities grow likelier with level; elites never drop grey, gold only drops from level 6 up, and the Unwitch leaves two purple or gold pieces. Drops cover head (hats, hoods, circlets), chest (robes, jerkins, mail), hands, feet, cloak, amulet and weapons (staffs, wands, sickles, spears). In the Inventory, names are coloured by rarity, ▲/▼ compares a piece with what you wear, and **Salvage** breaks unwanted gear into materials; merchants buy gear for silver.

## The witches

Every witch (you, your coven sisters, the elders and other players) is a detailed hero, and each path has its own look:

- **Bloom Witch:** pink hair streaked with green, a wide pink hat covered in flowers and hung with crystals, a petal gown in pink and spring green, butterflies about her, a green spell orb in one hand and a staff crowned with a glowing crystal lotus.
- **Bog Witch:** a hunched moss hag under a shroud of moss and hanging strands, glowing yellow eyes and a crooked grin, a little cauldron bubbling in one hand and a staff topped with a glowing mushroom trailing tendrils.
- **Hex Witch:** black and crimson laced with gold filigree, violet eyes, violet crystals on her hat, a swirl of runes turning in her off hand and a thorned staff holding a crystal.
- **Wild Witch:** an antler crown with a skull and feathers, face paint, fringed hides and a skull belt, bare feet, and a forked antler staff with a hanging lantern.

The **elders** who give the quests wear their path's style in a revealing cut: bare shoulders, arms and midriff, wrapped in their land's flowers, moss, lace or hides, with a great staff, crown and amulet.

Each worn piece of gear appears on her and grows richer with rarity: coloured trims, polished silver and gold, glowing gems and runes, and motes of light around epic and legendary gear. Capes ripple and trail, hair sways, and she walks, casts and rides her broom. The Inventory shows her in a turning portrait.

## Equipment and the broom

The **Inventory** shows ten slots: Head, Chest, Hands, Feet, Cloak, Amulet, Weapon, two Tools and Mount. Only worn gear counts: equipped tools set how much each strike gathers (a hatchet for wood, a pick for stone and moonstone), the weapon slot sets your strike (otherwise you hit with your best tool), armor reduces damage taken (25 armor blocks a third), a cloak keeps out the cold, and a Moonstone Amulet adds 25 mana. Newly crafted or bought gear puts itself on if its slot is free.

| Gear | Slot | Made from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hide Cap (armor 4), Bone Helm (9) | Head | hide + fiber; bone + hide |
| Hide Jerkin (10), Chitin Mail (20), Iron Mail (26) | Chest | hide + fiber; chitin + silk + hide; bought for 70 silver |
| Hide Cloak (2), Wool Cloak (3) | Cloak | hide + fiber; bought |
| Moonstone Amulet (+25 mana) | Amulet | moonstone + silk |
| Witch's Broom | Mount | wood + fiber + feathers |

Mount the broom with **F** to travel 70% faster; it skims over water as well as land. A plain broom cannot fly: cast the **Skyward Charm** [0] with a second witch beside you (an AI sister or another player in your coven) and it becomes a **Skyward Broom** for good, which flies on its own at 200% faster than walking: hold **Space** to climb and **X** to descend. Coven sisters ride alongside. Stepping off high in the air means a hard landing.

## Progression

- **Survival:** health, mana, stamina, food and water. Cold in the high mountains (craft a Hide Cloak or stay near fire). Poison from bites.
- **Skills** level with use: Gathering, Herbalism, Hunting, Alchemy, Spellcraft, Building.
- **Crafting** by hand: hatchet, pick, spear, staff, cloak, bandages.
- **Alchemy** at your Cauldron: Healing Draught, Mana Tonic, Swiftfoot Elixir, Venom Coating, Ironbark Brew, Gloamsight Philter, Coven Ink. At a Ritual Altar: Moonstone Dust and Heartfire Sigils.
- **Village:** found it with a Village Heart, then build within 60 m: Cauldron, Witch Hut (rest and respawn), Well, Herb Garden (grows homeland herbs), Warding Totem (beasts stay away), Ritual Altar, Palisade walls and Lantern Posts. Campfires can go anywhere.
- **The coven:** recruit the elder of each other path at her Hearth: the first at level 3, the second at level 6, the third at level 9, each for a potion gift brewed from her own land's herbs (Ironbark Brew for the Bog elder, Gloamsight Philter for the Hex elder, Healing Draught for the Bloom elder, Swiftfoot Elixir for the Wild elder). Sisters follow you and fight with their own spells.
- **Coven rites:** Summon Beast and Binding Circle (2 witches, Coven Ink), Storm of the Three and Call the Guardian (3 witches, Moonstone Dust), the Grand Rite (4 witches, Heartfire Sigil).
- **The ultimate summon:** the Wyrd Titan, paid for in human souls (see Human villages).
- **The end:** the Unwitch at the Crown takes only 10% damage until a Grand Rite cast within reach shatters her ward for 30 seconds, and she calls up to three thralls at a time. One batch of Heartfire Sigils (three) is enough for a Titan and two rites.

A fifteen-step quest line guides the way from first gathering to the Grand Rite.

## Current limits

This is a prototype. Players cannot damage each other, and human villages, their people and alarms are local to each player. Graphics are placeholder-level. Balance numbers are first guesses.

## Development

Requires Node.js 24 (22 works locally).

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
npm start
```

`npm start` rebuilds and runs the Coven server on port 8080 (set `PORT` to change it), with multiplayer. Do not open `Browser/index.html` directly; it is the build template. `npm run build` writes `Browser/Play-Coven.html` and `_site/index.html`.

### Performance

`npm run profile -- [class] [seconds] [auto|high|low]` builds an unminified copy, plays it in headless Chromium and prints frame times, draw calls, triangles and the JavaScript functions that cost the most per frame (set `CHROMIUM_PATH` to use an installed Chromium).

What keeps it light: each hero is drawn in a handful of calls, as one skinned mesh per finish (matte, satin, metal, see-through, glowing) whose bones are her moving parts, with colours painted into the vertices; the sky's gradient and glows are worked out per vertex, with stars as points and the aurora on a band of its own; terrain and resource nodes are lit once per vertex rather than per pixel; terrain heights are cached and distant chunks use fewer vertices (with skirts to hide seams); herbs, bushes and rocks are only drawn near you; landmarks and buildings are merged into one or two meshes each; nothing past the fog is drawn; campfire lights leave the shader in daylight; the HUD updates ten times a second and only touches what changed; and the server encodes each broadcast once.

### Hero lab

`node Scripts/hero_shots.mjs <folder> [class…]` renders each class's hero at three looks (starting gear, legendary gear, and the revealing elder) from the front, the back and close up, for checking the models.

### Playthrough

`npm run build && npm run playthrough -- [class] [first quest] [last quest]` lets a bot witch play the whole quest line in headless Chromium, through the game's own keys, mouse and pack buttons, many times faster than real time (`Scripts/playbot.mjs`): she walks round the Crown and the lairs, gathers, crafts, builds her village, brews, trades in a glamour, recruits her sisters, hunts the elite, takes souls, summons the Titan and fights the Unwitch, eating, drinking and healing as she goes. Whatever stops her (getting stuck, dying, a quest she cannot finish) is written to `test-results/playthrough-<class>.md` with screenshots along the way; if she cannot finish a quest she is helped past it and the run goes on.

### Browser test

```sh
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm run build
npm run test:browser
```

Set `CHROMIUM_PATH` to use an installed Chromium. The test serves the game at the Pages subpath, picks a class, walks, builds a village, brews at the cauldron, checks coven-spell gating, hunts a wolf with spells, opens the map, and breaks the Unwitch's ward with a four-witch Grand Rite. A third test runs a player-hosted game through a local PeerJS broker: a host gets a code, a guest joins with it, they share the world, a wrong code is reported and the host leaving is handled. A second test starts the real server with two browsers and checks presence, a real two-player coven rite, shared harvesting, shared villages, chat, shared creatures (kill credit, bites across players, handover when a player leaves) and leaving. Both fail on any browser error. Screenshots go to `test-results/`.
